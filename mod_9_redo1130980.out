I am running the following nnUNet: 3d_fullres
My trainer class is:  <class 'nnunet.training.network_training.nnUNetTrainerV2.nnUNetTrainerV2'>
For that I will be using the following configuration:
num_classes:  3
modalities:  {0: 'FLAIR', 1: 'T1w', 2: 't1gd', 3: 'T2w'}
use_mask_for_norm OrderedDict([(0, True), (1, True), (2, True), (3, True)])
keep_only_largest_region None
min_region_size_per_class None
min_size_per_class None
normalization_schemes OrderedDict([(0, 'nonCT'), (1, 'nonCT'), (2, 'nonCT'), (3, 'nonCT')])

I am using stage 0 from these plans
I am using sample dice + CE loss
